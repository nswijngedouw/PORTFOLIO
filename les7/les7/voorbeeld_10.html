				<h3>Uncertainty principle</h3>

				<p>
					In <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Wikipedia: Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, the <b>Heisenberg uncertainty principle</b> states by precise inequalities that certain pairs of physical properties,
					such as position and <a href="/wiki/Momentum" title="Wikipedia: Momentum">momentum</a>, cannot be simultaneously known to arbitrarily high precision. That is, the more precisely one property is measured, the less
					precisely the other can be measured.
				</p>

				<p>
					Published by <a href="/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg" title="Wikipedia: Werner Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> in 1927, the principle means that it is impossible to <i>determine</i> simultaneously both the position and the
					momentum of an electron or any other particle with any great degree of accuracy or certainty. This is not a statement about researchers' ability to measure the quantities. Rather, it is a statement about the
					system itself. That is, a system cannot be <i>defined</i> to have simultaneously singular values of these pairs of quantities. The principle states that a minimum exists for the product of the uncertainties
					in these properties that is equal to or greater than one half of the <a href="/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant" title="Wikipedia: Reduced Planck constant">reduced Planck constant</a>
					(<i>ħ</i> = <i>h</i>/2π).
				</p>

				<p>
					In quantum physics, a particle is described by a <a href="/wiki/Wave_packet" title="Wikipedia: Wave packet">wave packet</a>, which gives rise to this phenomenon. Consider the measurement of the position of a particle.
					It could be anywhere. The particle's wave packet has non-zero <a href="/wiki/Amplitude" title="Wikipedia: Amplitude">amplitude</a>, meaning the position is <b>uncertain</b> – it could be almost anywhere along the wave packet.
					To obtain an accurate reading of position, this wave packet must be 'compressed' as much as possible, meaning it must be made up of increasing numbers of
					<a href="/wiki/Sine_waves" title="Wikipedia: Sine waves">sine waves</a><a href="/wiki/Superposition_principle" title="Wikipedia: Superposition principle">added together</a>. The momentum of the particle is proportional
					to the <a href="/wiki/Wavenumber" title="Wikipedia: Wavenumber">wavenumber</a> of one of these waves, but it <i>could be</i> any of them. So a more precise position measurement – by adding together more waves – means the
					momentum measurement becomes less precise (and vice versa).
				</p>

				<p>
					The only kind of wave with a definite position is concentrated at one point, and such a wave has an indefinite wavelength (and therefore an indefinite momentum). Conversely, the only kind of wave with a definite
					wavelength is an infinite regular periodic oscillation over all space, which has no definite position. So in quantum mechanics, there can be no states that describe a particle with both a definite position and a
					definite momentum. The more precise the position, the less precise the momentum.
